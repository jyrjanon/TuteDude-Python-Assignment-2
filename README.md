Task 1:
Here, we first took a number from the user and stored in variable "a", then we applied the formula (number%==0) that if number divided by 2 has remainder as zero then it is even number else it odd.

Task 2:
Here , we first initialised sum=0, then we used for loop to iterate from 1-50 and then we kept adding sum and i and stored in sum (sum==sum+i) and at the last outside the loop we printed the sum.
